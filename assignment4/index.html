            <h3>About Section</h3>
            <p>Group16 is an Canadian app-based stock brokerage that offers commission-free trading.
                The various fees attached to trading stocks often deter young people from entering the market, but by eliminating fees and streamlining the process, Group16 hopes to open up trading to a new demographic.
                In 2016, Group16 launched a subscription model, Group16 Gold. For $10 per month, users get instant deposits (no three-day waiting period), and can trade just before the market is open and just after it has closed.
                That privilege is designed to lure more experienced traders from other brokerages. The company also expanded into China, through a partnership with Baidu, allowing Chinese citizens to buy and sell U.S. stock via an app integration.</p>
            <h3>History of The Company</h3>
            <p>Our story began at Stanford, where co-founders Baiju and Vlad were roommates and classmates. After graduating, they packed their bags for New York City and built two finance companies, selling their own trading software to hedge funds. There, they discovered that big Wall Street firms were paying next-to-nothing to trade stocks, while most Americans were charged commission for every single trade.
                They wanted to change that, so they headed back to California to build a financial product that would give everyone—not just the wealthy—access to financial markets.</p>
            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>To We strive to uphold our values every day.</p>
            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>Group16's mission is to democratize finance for all. We believe that everyone should have access to the financial markets, so we’ve built Robinhood from the ground up to make investing friendly, approachable, and understandable for newcomers and experts alike.
                our values are in service of our customers. We strive to uphold our values every day.</p>
